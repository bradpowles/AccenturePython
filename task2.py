Peter's Pool Problem

Peter needs to work out how many litres of water he needs to fill his pool this summer!
We can assume 1 cubic metre is 1000 litres. And the dimensions for his pool are 20 metres in length, 10 metres width and 2 metres deep.

Create a python program to help Peter order the correct amount of water.
